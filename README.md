Topics Covered
Explore 101
I began with an introduction to data science, including its key concepts, the data science pipeline, and how to approach problems from a data-driven perspective.

Preparing Data
I learned how to clean, preprocess, and transform raw data into a usable format for analysis. This included dealing with missing values, handling outliers, and performing feature engineering.

SQL
I practiced writing SQL queries to retrieve, filter, aggregate, and manipulate data stored in relational databases. This helped me understand how to efficiently work with large datasets using SQL.

Data Visualization and Storytelling
I explored various data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and learned how to create compelling visual stories that effectively communicate data insights to different stakeholders.

Python
Python was my primary tool for working with data. I learned how to use libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to perform data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Regression
I developed models to predict continuous variables using techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and regularization methods like Ridge and Lasso.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
I worked on text data using NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF). I also explored sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and building NLP-based classifiers.

Unsupervised Learning
I applied clustering techniques like K-means and hierarchical clustering to group data points, and used dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to simplify datasets without losing important information.

AWS Foundations
I gained an introduction to AWS services, including cloud storage, computing, and machine learning deployment. I learned how to set up an environment to deploy and manage machine learning models on the cloud.

Projects
Throughout the program, I worked on several projects, including:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaning and transforming a messy dataset into a usable format.
SQL Querying: Retrieving insights from large datasets using SQL.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing datasets to extract meaningful insights.
Machine Learning Models: Building and evaluating regression, classification, and clustering models.
NLP Project: Analyzing text data to perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
AWS Deployment: Deploying a machine learning model on AWS.
Tools and Technologies
Languages: Python, SQL
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, SpaCy
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
Cloud Services: AWS (S3, EC2, SageMaker)
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Conclusion
This program has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of data science, from data preparation to deploying models on the cloud. I now feel confident in my ability to tackle real-world data challenges and continue my journey in the field of data science.
